Here is some instructions to run the tests

# Playwright Test Project

This project contains automated tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). The tests are designed to validate the functionality of a web application, including form inputs, field validations, and other key features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14.x or higher).
- You have a GitHub account.
- You have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duanem3/Playwright_IgniteData.git

**Navigate to the project directory**

3. Install Dependencies

npm install
This command will install all required dependencies, including Playwright.

**4. Install Playwright Browsers**
Playwright needs to install specific browser binaries (like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) to run the tests. Run:


npx playwright install

**5. Running the Tests**
You can run all tests using the following command:


npx playwright test

To run the tests in headed mode and in chrome (with the browser UI visible):


npx playwright test --project chromium --headed


**6. Running Specific Tests**
To run a specific test file:

bash
Copy code
npx playwright test tests/your-test-file.spec.js
Replace your-test-file.spec.js with the test file you want to run

For example, npx playwright test UpdatingAlreadyExistingUser.spec --project chromium --headed 

7. Viewing the Test Report
After running the tests, you can generate and view a detailed HTML report:

npx playwright show-report
This command opens the report in your default browser.
